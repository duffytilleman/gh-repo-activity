### Committing changes
This project uses jujutsu (`jj`)
See staged changes with `jj show`
Commit changes with `jj commit -m <MESSAGE>`. No need to do `git add`
Commit message guidance:
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
